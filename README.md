# jCart
eCommerce Shopping Cart system built on PHP

jCart is a free Ajax shopping cart thatâ€™s easy to install and customize.
Based on jQuery and PHP, jCart handles visitor input without reloading the page and is fully functional even without javascript.

jCart was created by Doug Whitney, and maintained through version 1.3, when he stopped development.

During that time Justin Ryan assisted Doug with bugfixes, and online user support and created some of his own
private modifications to jCart from his work on various websites, and he decided to release them publicly.

I came across jCart while volunteering on a website.  I noticed it uses jQuery 1.3.2 which had some vulnerabilities so I updated jCart to the newest librar, added $.noConflict(), and enclosed all jQuery in IIFE's so that $ could still be used by other libraries without conflict.
